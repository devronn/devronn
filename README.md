### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My favourite quotes:
- "Weâ€™re all stories, in the end. Just make it a good one, eh?"
- "Do you know what thinking is? Itâ€™s just a fancy word for changing your mind."
- "In 900 years of time and space, Iâ€™ve never met anyone who wasnâ€™t important"
- "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away"
- "Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection"
- "The secret of getting ahead is getting started"
- "With enough random bobble heads running around trying to commit sacrilege on your codebase it quickly becomes a problem of control to maintain the quality"
- "It does not do well to dwell on dreams and forget to live"
